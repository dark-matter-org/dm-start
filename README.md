# dm-start

The dm-start project provides the template of a dark-matter Domain Specific Language (DSL) project.

The dark-matter mechanisms allow you to focus on the conceptual model of the domain you're dealing
with and provides a modular persistence/specification approach that minimizes the coding involved.
All of the infrastructure required to parse, load and organize your configuration objects for use
in your application is generated for you based on a schema specification.

By running the [bootstrap](#2-1-run-dsl-bootstrap) utility and providing a java package and name for the DSL, you'll get the following:

- an example schema specification
- the code generated from that schema
- a module (configuration file) that contains examples of the DSL concepts
- a module loader class that parses/loads your DSL modules
- an example utility that allows you to load one or more modules
- A JUnit test that executes the DSL utility
- the Maven pom required to create a shaded (self-contained), executable jar of the DSL

# 1 Environment Setup

## 1.1 Requirements

- JDK 1.8
- Eclipse at [2020-12-R (4.18)](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-12/r) or earlier (the Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers version is a good choice)

## 1.2 Preference tweaks

Once Eclipse is installed, it's recommended that you make the following changes to your preferences:

- Version Control (Team) -> Git - Set: Default repository folder to: **${workspace_loc}**
- Maven -> Errors/Warnings - Set: Plugin execution not covered by lifecyle configuration to: **Ignore**

NOTE: When executing the Maven build for your DSL within Eclipse, you may see [warnings](); you may safely ignore them.



# 2 Create your DSL

## 2.1 Run DSL Bootstrap

In the Eclipse menu bar, select the small black triangle next to the green "Run Configuration" icon and select "DSL Bootstrap":

![run bootstrap](images/run-bootstrap.png)

You will be prompted to enter a new Java package name - in this case, `com.example.xdsl` and an 
abbreviation/file extension for your DSL, in this case, `xdsl`

![run bootstrap](images/enter-package-and-abbrev.png)

After hitting enter after your abbreviation, you'll see feedback on the files being generated:

![run bootstrap](images/code-generated.png)

Once the DSL has been generated, right click the dm-start project and select "Refresh":

![run bootstrap](images/refresh-project.png)

## 2.2 Run Maven Install

Right click the project and select "Run As -> Maven install" - this will create a shaded, executable jar of your DSL project:

![run bootstrap](images/maven-install.png)

As a result of this, you will see that various artifacts are created in your local Maven repository.
In the case of this example you'll see the following artifacts in `~/.m2/repository/com/example/xdsl/xdsl/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`:
* `xdsl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
* `xdsl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.pom`
* `xdsl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`

Of these, the most important is the `shaded` JAR - this is an executable JAR that can be provided to users of your DSL.

If you create an alias like: <br>
`alias xdsl='~/.m2/repository/com/example/xdsl/xdsl/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/xdsl-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar'`

And then run `xdsl` you'll see the help associated with the generated utility that exists in `com.example.xdsl.tools.xdslutil.XdslUtilMain`

## 2.3 Run JUnit for XdslutilMain

In you project explorer, navigate to:

![run bootstrap](images/unit-test.png)

Right click `XdslUtilMainTest` and select Run As -> JUnit Test

You'll see the following output:

![run bootstrap](images/unit-test-output.png)

Running the test has read the contents of `data/example.xdsl` that contained:

![run bootstrap](images/example-xdsl.png)

## 2.4 Generated code structure

The bootstrap process will result in the following set of code and configuration generated beneath the
`com.example.xdsl` package in `src/main/java` and `src/test/java`:

![run bootstrap](images/generated-structure.png)

You will notice several `generated` directories in this hierarchy. These are generated by the dark-matter
code generation mechanisms and are not intended to be checked in to your resulting project. Attendent `.gitignore`
files have been set to ignore the `generated` directories.

The following sections indicate some of the more important directories and what you'll find in them.

NOTE: the `shared` and `server` nomenclature for the two primary directories results from dark-matter's
original development to support the creation of  
[Google Web Toolkit](http://www.gwtproject.org/)
projects. Another tutorial will be created to demonstrate these capabilities.


### The dark-matter schema directory

The `com.example.xdsl.shared.dmconfig` directory contains the dark-matter schema specification that 
defines the concepts associated with your DSL.

## Maven Warnings

Within Eclipse, you may see a warning like:

![run bootstrap](images/maven-warnings.png)

You may safely ignore these warnings - but if you want further information on them, see the following Stack Overflow question: [Eclipse Maven: SLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63518376/eclipse-maven-slf4j-class-path-contains-multiple-slf4j-bindings)
